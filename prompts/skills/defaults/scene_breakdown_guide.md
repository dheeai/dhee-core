**PURPOSE**: Break a scene into individual cinematic shots for video generation. Each shot is a brief structural description — detailed frame prompts and generation strategy are handled downstream by the shot_image_prompt step.

## Canonical refIds — USE EXACTLY, NEVER INVENT

Whenever you write a character, setting, or object reference in this JSON — `mainSubject`, `secondarySubject`, `perspectiveOf`, `focus.primary`, `focus.background[]`, `focus.lurking` — you MUST use the exact refId string from the `<available_refs>` block the system provides in your user message.

Do NOT paraphrase, normalize casing, drop punctuation, or "fix" spellings. The refId is a database key — if the profile is `johnathan_o'hare`, write `johnathan_o'hare` (with the apostrophe). If the setting is `andy's_bar`, write `andy's_bar`. Downstream code looks up per-item nodes by these exact strings; any mismatch silently breaks reference image resolution.

Common failure modes to avoid:
- Converting `johnathan_o'hare` → `johnathan_o_hare` (underscore substituted for apostrophe)
- Converting `johnathan_o'hare` → `johnathan` (dropping last-name)
- Typos (`jonathan` ≠ `johnathan`)
- Inventing IDs from prose in the scene script — always use the provided refIds
- Referring to a character or setting that isn't in `<available_refs>` (the LLM invents one, downstream finds nothing)

If the scene needs an entity that isn't in `<available_refs>`, describe it by prose in the shot description instead of referring to it by refId. Never invent a refId.

---

## Scene Transitions — REQUIRED FIELDS (entry / exit)

Every scene declares two strings at the top level:

- **`entry`**: 1–2 sentences describing how this scene visually picks up
  from the prior scene's last frame. The first shot of this scene must
  begin from that exact composition (same character pose, same threshold)
  with only the new scene's setting starting to come into view.
- **`exit`**: 1–2 sentences describing how this scene sets up the next
  scene's opener. The last shot's last_frame must show the main subject
  at a threshold (door, edge, gate) that the next scene will pick up.

The user's rule (treat as law): **end of scene N flows into start of
scene N+1**. The character exits door A in scene N's last shot; in
scene N+1's first shot, they enter through the same door on the other
side. No teleporting, no "and now we're somewhere else."

For the first scene of the project: `entry` describes how the project
opens (e.g., "Fade-in from black on the protagonist already in place at
the village wall"). For the last scene: `exit` describes the closing
(e.g., "Hold on the protagonist's silhouette at the dawn road").

```json
{
  "entry": "Lena steps off the trap-door threshold from scene 1's exit, foot landing on damp moss.",
  "exit": "Lena halts at the forest edge, the dawn road and patrol car visible through the trees ahead.",
  "shots": [...]
}
```

These transitions are not narrative-only — the image pipeline reads them
to chain `scene_N_shot_1.first_frame` on `scene_(N-1).last_shot.last_frame`.
Vague exits like "she walks away" produce vague handoffs.

## One Setting Per Scene — HARD RULE

A scene = one location. Every shot in a scene must reference the **same**
`setting` refId via `focus.primary` or `focus.background[]`. If your scene
needs more than one setting, that's a sign you should **split it into two
scenes** — the second scene starts where the first ended (e.g. character
exits door A, scene 2 opens with them entering location B).

The only exception: when the main subject is physically traversing between
two locations within the same continuous beat (running through a forest,
crossing a marketplace), you may reference 2 settings ONLY if you also
include a shot with `continuityRole: 'bridge'` (or `entry`/`exit`) marking
the transition.

The image generator has 4 reference slots total. Slot 1 is reserved for the
setting (the base canvas). Two settings competing for slot 1 produces
mangled framing — see the "Out of this world" diner shots and "The Village"
shot 2.3 for cautionary examples.

## Reference cap per shot — 4 maximum

Across the union of `mainSubject`, `secondarySubject`, `focus.primary`,
`focus.background[]`, and `focus.lurking`, a single shot must reference at
most 4 distinct entities. Drop priority when over: extra settings first
(keep one), then non-mainSubject characters, then the secondary subject.
Never put a character in `focus.background[]` purely as decoration — it
costs a slot.

## Scene Main Subject — REQUIRED

Every scene MUST declare `mainSubject` at the scene_video_prompt level — **copied verbatim from the character refIds in `<available_refs>`**. Example: if the available refs list includes `vikram`, write `"mainSubject": "vikram"` — never `"Vikram"`, `"vikram_reddy"`, or `"protagonist"`.

- Shot perspectives are interpreted relative to this subject.
- The scene's shot flow should GENERALLY follow the main subject — their decisions, reactions, and movements drive the camera.
- When a second character is pivotal (dialogue/confrontation), declare `secondarySubject` as well — also copied verbatim from `<available_refs>`.

The main subject can change between scenes, but within a scene stays fixed. **The same character uses the same refId across every scene** — don't invent variants.

## Before Writing Shots — MANDATORY PRE-PLANNING

**Step 1: Beat list.** List every beat in the scene — every action, dialogue moment, reaction, transition. Each beat gets at least one shot. Do not merge distinct beats.

**Step 2: Dialogue audit.** For EVERY dialogue beat, count the words and pre-compute required duration (see Dialogue Timing below). Write this number down BEFORE drafting the shot. If a line exceeds the 15s cap, plan to split it across multiple shots now — not later.

**Step 2a: One speaker per shot.** The video model generates ONE continuous shot per motion directive and cannot reliably route two different speakers' dialogue to the correct mouths. If a beat has two characters in conversation, split them:
- Shot N: character A speaks (audio = `"NAME_A: line..."`)
- Shot N+1: character B speaks (audio = `"NAME_B: reply..."`)

A single shot's `audio` field MUST contain at most ONE `NAME:` pattern. Ambient sound after the dialogue is fine ("cicada hum, distant traffic"), but never a second speaker. If you're tempted to write `"PARVATI: line1. ISHA: line2."` in one shot, SPLIT instead — two short shots read naturally, one mis-attributed shot reads broken.

**Step 3: Purpose sequence check.** Decide the opening purpose:
   - If shot 1 is `set_the_world` or `set_the_mood` → shot 2 (or the first shot that contains a character) MUST be `meet_character`. No exceptions.
   - If shot 1 opens directly with characters already present and acting → use `meet_character` or `show_action` as shot 1; do NOT use `set_the_world`/`set_the_mood` as a decorative opener.
   - Never follow `set_the_world`/`set_the_mood` with `show_dialogue`, `show_reaction`, or `show_action` before the characters have been introduced via `meet_character`.

**Step 4: Establishing shots must establish something specific:**
   - Extreme wide: show scale, weather, or atmosphere (e.g., "rain-soaked marketplace at night, stalls collapsed")
   - Extreme close-up: a sensory detail (e.g., "raindrops striking a brass bell", "embers floating")
   - NOT just "the empty setting" — what is happening in this environment?

## Required Fields — Every Shot, No Exceptions

Every shot object MUST contain exactly these 7 fields. Missing or empty fields = broken output.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shotNumber` | number | Sequential integer starting at 1 |
| `purpose` | string | WHY this shot exists (see Purpose section below) |
| `duration` | number | Seconds (3–15). Quick cuts: 3–4s. Emotional holds: 6–8s. **Dialogue shots MUST fit the full line — see Dialogue Timing below** |
| `description` | string | 1–2 sentence visual brief of what happens |
| `cameraWork` | string | Start with framing (wide, medium, close-up, extreme close-up), then angle and movement |
| `audio` | string | Everything heard: dialogue, ambient, effects, or silence (see Audio section) |
| `transition` | string | How this shot transitions FROM the previous shot (see Transitions section) |

```json
{
  "shotNumber": 1,
  "purpose": "set_the_mood",
  "duration": 4,
  "description": "Raindrops strike a brass bell, each impact sending tiny ripples across the wet metal.",
  "cameraWork": "extreme close-up, macro, static, shallow DOF on bell surface",
  "audio": "metallic ring of rain on brass, distant thunder rumble",
  "transition": "fade"
}
```

## Dialogue Timing — Shot Duration Must Fit the Line (CRITICAL)

The video model generates exactly the duration you request. If a shot carries 25 words of dialogue but you set `duration: 3`, the video cuts off mid-sentence. This is the #1 cause of broken outputs — treat it as a hard validation rule, not a guideline.

**The formula — apply to every dialogue shot:**

```
word_count     = number of words in all speaker turns in this shot
base_seconds   = word_count / 2.5          # conversational speech rate
duration       = ceil(base_seconds) + 1    # +1s buffer for lead-in/tail
```

**Minimum duration lookup table — use this directly:**

| Word count | MINIMUM duration |
|---:|---:|
| 1–2 words | **3s** |
| 3–5 words | **3s** |
| 6–7 words | **4s** |
| 8–10 words | **5s** |
| 11–12 words | **6s** |
| 13–15 words | **7s** |
| 16–17 words | **8s** |
| 18–20 words | **9s** |
| 21–22 words | **10s** |
| 23–25 words | **11s** |
| 26–27 words | **12s** |
| 28–30 words | **13s** |
| 31–32 words | **14s** |
| 33–35 words | **15s (CAP)** |
| 36+ words | **SPLIT across shots** |

**Worked examples:**

| Dialogue | Words | Minimum duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| "Stay down." | 2 | **3s** |
| "We need to move. The signal is weak." | 8 | **5s** |
| "Captain, the engines are offline and the hull is breached. Life support will fail in minutes." | 17 | **8s** |
| "I told you not to come here again. Last time it nearly cost us everything, and I am not burying another brother for your schemes." | 27 | **12s** |
| A monologue of 40+ words | 40+ | **SPLIT** — e.g. 18 words in shot A (9s) → reaction cutaway → 22 words in shot B (10s) |

**Hard rules:**
- Count only words inside the speaker turn (between `NAME:` and the next non-dialogue phrase). Ambient descriptions in the same audio line don't count.
- If multiple characters speak in the same shot, SUM all dialogue word counts.
- **Cap is 15s per shot.** If a single uninterrupted line needs more than 15s, split the line across two or more shots. Typical split pattern: `show_dialogue` (first half) → `show_reaction` (listener, 3–4s cutaway) → `show_dialogue` (second half).
- When splitting, write the first half in shot N's `audio`, the second half in shot N+M's `audio`. Never duplicate lines across shots.
- Silent / ambient-only shots follow the normal 3–10s guidance.
- When unsure, ROUND UP. A 1-second overshoot is invisible; a 1-second undershoot cuts a word.

**Pre-flight check — do this for every shot before finalizing:**
1. Does `audio` contain a `NAME:` or `(V.O.):` pattern? If yes, count the words.
2. Look up the minimum duration in the table above.
3. Is `duration` ≥ the minimum? If no, increase it or split the shot.

## Purpose — WHY This Shot Exists

Every shot serves a story function. Pick the single most important purpose for this shot.

| Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|
| `set_the_world` | Establish WHERE/WHEN — wide/aerial showing location, time, weather |
| `set_the_mood` | Sensory/atmosphere detail — close-up on rain, fire, texture, sound |
| `meet_character` | First time we SEE a character — they enter, are revealed, or appear |
| `show_tension` | Conflict building — something is wrong, stakes rising |
| `show_action` | Physical event — chase, fight, discovery, movement |
| `show_reaction` | Response to something — facial expression, body language |
| `show_dialogue` | Conversation — character speaking |
| `show_clue` | Important detail — object, letter, clock, evidence |
| `show_passage` | Time or space transition — montage beat, travel |
| `hold_emotion` | Linger on a feeling — let it breathe, longer duration |
| `show_change` | Transformation or VFX — something morphs, dissolves, ignites |
| `punctuate` | Dramatic emphasis — exclamation mark shot |

### Purpose Sequence — HARD RULES

These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them produces jarring edits and confused audiences.

**Rule 1: The "Establish then Meet" rule.**
If shot N uses `set_the_world` OR `set_the_mood`, then the FIRST subsequent shot that contains a character MUST use `meet_character`. You cannot jump from `set_the_world` → `show_dialogue`, nor from `set_the_mood` → `show_action`, nor from `set_the_world` → `show_reaction`. The character must be formally introduced to the frame first.

   - ✅ `set_the_world` → `meet_character` → `show_dialogue`
   - ✅ `set_the_mood` → `set_the_world` → `meet_character` → `show_action`
   - ❌ `set_the_world` → `show_dialogue` (missing `meet_character`)
   - ❌ `set_the_mood` → `show_reaction` (missing `meet_character`)
   - ❌ `set_the_world` → `set_the_mood` → `show_action` (character entered without `meet_character`)

**Rule 2: No stacked establishers without payoff.**
Do not chain more than 2 establishing shots (`set_the_world`/`set_the_mood`) before introducing a character. Two is the maximum; a third feels like a travelogue.

**Rule 3: `meet_character` is one-shot-per-character-per-scene.**
Once a character has been introduced with `meet_character` in this scene, subsequent shots of them use `show_dialogue`, `show_reaction`, `show_action`, etc. — not another `meet_character`. The exception: a NEW character entering later uses `meet_character` for their first appearance.

**Rule 4: Dialogue needs setup.**
A shot with dialogue (`show_dialogue`) should be preceded by at least one shot that establishes WHO is speaking — either `meet_character` (first appearance) or the speaker was on-screen in the prior shot. Do not open a scene directly with `show_dialogue` unless the very first frame also introduces the speaker clearly (in which case tag it `meet_character` with dialogue in the audio).

**Rule 5: Opening options.**
Valid scene openings:
   - `set_the_world` → `meet_character` → ...
   - `set_the_mood` → `meet_character` → ...
   - `set_the_world` → `set_the_mood` → `meet_character` → ...
   - `meet_character` → ... (skip establishing, start with character)
   - `show_action` → ... (in-media-res, only if the action itself reveals who's there)

Invalid openings:
   - Starting with `show_dialogue`, `show_reaction`, `show_tension`, `hold_emotion` without prior `meet_character` in this scene.

## Perspective — WHOSE POV IS THIS SHOT FROM

Every `show_action` and `meet_character` shot MUST declare `perspective`. Other shots SHOULD declare it when meaningful.

| Perspective | When to use |
|---|---|
| `main_subject` | POV or over-the-shoulder of the scene's mainSubject. **Default flow — majority of shots.** |
| `secondary_subject` | POV or OTS of secondarySubject. Use for reaction reversals in dialogue. |
| `observer` | Neutral third-person. Use when neither character's viewpoint should dominate (wide establishing conversations, action seen from outside). |
| `overhead` | High-angle/birds-eye looking down. Use for spatial establishing or subject-feels-small moments. |
| `god` | Impossible omniscient viewpoint (extreme wide, birds-eye). Reserve for scale moments. |

**Flow rules:**
- Shots should GENERALLY follow the mainSubject — non-overhead perspectives default to `main_subject` unless the story calls for a reversal.
- When the mainSubject is meeting a new character, use `main_subject` perspective (we see through THEIR eyes as the other person enters).
- Reserve `overhead`/`god` for specific spatial or tonal moments, not casual use.
- For dialogue scenes, alternate `main_subject` and `secondary_subject` to create the shot/reverse-shot rhythm.

**Hard rule — NEVER write `over-the-shoulder` (or OTS) into `cameraWork` when only ONE character is in the shot.** OTS is inherently a two-character composition: foreground anchor (blurred) + focal subject (sharp). With a single character, the image model either invents a phantom second character or breaks focus. For tight intimate framings of one character (camera angled over their own shoulder, focusing on hands or an object), use `insert`, `extreme_close_up`, or `close_up` in `cameraWork` instead — and write the subject as the focal element (hands, object, face detail), not the character themselves. The `perspective` field can remain `main_subject` for these intimate single-character shots; just don't pair it with OTS framing in `cameraWork`.

**`perspectiveOf` field:** If a shot's perspective is tied to a specific character, you may set `perspectiveOf` to their refId. When omitted and perspective is `main_subject`, it defaults to `mainSubject`.

## Focus — WHAT'S SHARP VS BLURRED

The `focus` object (optional but recommended for non-establishing shots) specifies what's razor-sharp and what's defocused:

```json
"focus": {
  "primary": "laila_face",
  "background": ["bronze_seal", "vikram_shoulder"],
  "lurking": "cloaked_figure"
}
```

- **`primary`** (required if focus is used): what's razor-sharp — refId preferred, prose allowed (e.g., `"bronze_seal"`, `"vikram_face"`, `"the torn letter"`).
- **`background`**: visible but blurred elements — characters/objects we can see but are not the focal point.
- **`lurking`** (optional): a defocused element planted for a later focus-pull. If shot N sets `lurking: cloaked_figure`, shot N+1 or N+2 should pull `focus.primary: cloaked_figure` as the focus pull payoff.

**Use focus to:**
- Create visual priority — who/what should the viewer look at?
- Plant future tension — lurking elements become important later.
- Give shot composition specific DOF guidance.

## Continuity Bridging — NO TELEPORTING

The **main subject cannot teleport between locations**. If the mainSubject changes location between shots, you MUST insert bridging shots.

**`continuityRole` values:**
- `entry` — main subject arrives in a new location (coming through a door, stepping into frame from off-screen)
- `exit` — main subject leaves a location (rising, walking to door, opening door, stepping through)
- `bridge` — travel/montage beat between locations (running down alley, crossing bridge)
- `none` (default) — not a bridging shot

**Rules:**
- If mainSubject is in location A at shot N and location B at shot N+2, you need either an `exit` shot (leaving A) and/or `entry` shot (arriving at B) in between.
- Never jump from "seated in room A" to "seated in room B" for the main subject without a bridge.
- Secondary subjects may appear/disappear between scenes without bridges (they have their own off-screen lives).
- Short time-skips can use `crossfade` or `dip_to_black` transitions instead of a `bridge` shot, but physical movement still needs depiction.

**Example bridge sequence for mainSubject leaving a dhaba and arriving at a temple:**
1. `exit`: Vikram rises from the table, drops coins
2. `exit`: Vikram pushes through the dhaba's curtain into the rain
3. `bridge`: Vikram runs down a rain-soaked alley (montage beat)
4. `entry`: Vikram arrives at the temple steps, breathing hard

## Description Field

The `description` field is a brief 1–2 sentence summary of what happens in this shot. It should capture:
- The main action or event
- Who is involved
- The emotional beat

This is NOT a detailed image prompt — keep it concise. The downstream shot_image_prompt step will expand this into full frame descriptions with proper cinematographer prose.

## Audio Field

The `audio` field captures **everything heard** in a shot — dialogue, ambient sound, effects, and silence — in a single field. Never leave it empty.

**Format rules:**
- **Dialogue**: prefix with character name in caps: `"ELENA: Don't follow me. Rain on pavement, footsteps receding"`
- **Voiceover**: prefix with V.O.: `"ELENA (V.O.): I should have known. Soft piano underscore"`
- **Ambient only** (no dialogue): `"wind through trees, distant sirens"`
- **Explicit silence**: `"silence"` or `"near-silence, faint hum of fluorescent lights"`
- **Multiple elements**: combine with commas: `"MARCUS: Stay here. Thunder crack, rain intensifying, door creaking shut"`

**Rules:**
- Every shot MUST have a non-empty `audio` field
- If the scene description includes spoken dialogue, every line MUST appear in the correct shot's `audio` field — do not skip or omit any dialogue
- If a shot has no dialogue, describe the ambient sounds or effects heard
- Distribute dialogue across the correct shots — match which shot the line is spoken during
- **Before finalizing each shot, re-count the dialogue words and verify `duration` meets the minimum from the Dialogue Timing table**

## Transitions

Every shot MUST have a `transition` field. No exceptions.

Each shot specifies how it transitions FROM the previous shot. The first shot of a scene uses `cut` or `fade` (use `fade` if opening from black).

**Transition types:**
- **`cut`** — hard cut, no effect. Default for most shot-to-shot cuts within a continuous action
- **`crossfade`** — smooth dissolve between shots. Use for time passing, dreamlike moments, parallel action
- **`fade`** — fade through black. Use for scene openings, significant time jumps, finality
- **`dip_to_black`** — fade out > brief black hold > fade in. Classic trailer "breather" beat. Use between scenes or to punctuate dramatic moments
- **`flash_to_white`** — quick white flash. Use for impact moments, explosions, revelations, smash cuts
- **`circle_close`** — contracting circle (blink/iris effect). Use for POV shots, focusing attention, dreamy or surreal moments
- **`circle_open`** — expanding circle reveal. Use to open a new location or reveal a surprise
- **`wipe_left`** / **`wipe_right`** — directional wipe. Use for location changes, parallel storylines, comic/graphic style
- **`slide_left`** / **`slide_right`** — new shot slides in. Use for montage sequences, fast-paced editing
- **`radial`** — radial wipe. Use sparingly for stylistic effect

**Guidelines:**
- Most cuts within a scene should be `cut` — transitions are seasoning, not the main course
- Use `dip_to_black` between scenes or for trailer-style dramatic pauses
- Match transition to emotional beat: `flash_to_white` for shock, `crossfade` for tenderness, `circle_close` for introspection
- First shot of scene 1: `fade` (opening from black). Last shot's transition to the next scene: `dip_to_black` or `fade`

## Camera Work

- Start with framing: wide, medium, close-up, extreme close-up
- Then add angle and movement: "close-up, low angle, slow push-in as tension builds"
- Keep it concise — a short phrase, not a paragraph

## Pre-Output Checklist — RUN EVERY ITEM

Before returning JSON, verify every item. Failing any item = broken output.

1. Every scene beat has a shot
2. Duration sum ≈ totalDuration (within ±20%). Each shot is 3–15 seconds.
3. **DIALOGUE FIT AUDIT** — for every shot whose `audio` contains `NAME:` or `(V.O.):`:
   - Count the dialogue words
   - Look up minimum duration in the Dialogue Timing table
   - Verify `duration` ≥ minimum
   - If any line would require >15s, confirm it has been split across multiple shots
4. **Every shot has all 7 required fields**: `shotNumber`, `purpose`, `duration`, `description`, `cameraWork`, `audio`, `transition` — none empty
5. **Every shot has a valid `purpose`** from the taxonomy — not a made-up value
6. **PURPOSE SEQUENCE AUDIT** — walk through shots in order:
   - If any `set_the_world` or `set_the_mood` appears, confirm the next character-containing shot is `meet_character`
   - Confirm no more than 2 establishing shots in a row
   - Confirm the scene's opening matches one of the valid openings in Rule 5
   - Confirm no `show_dialogue` appears before the speaker has been introduced via `meet_character` (or is present in the opening frame)
7. **Every shot has an `audio` field** with dialogue (if any) + ambient/effects
8. **Every shot has a `transition` field** — first shot uses `fade` or `cut`
9. All dialogue placed in the correct shot's `audio` field — no lines omitted
10. Pacing varies: quick cuts for tension, longer holds for emotion
11. **Scene declares `mainSubject`** — and the value is **copied verbatim from `<available_refs>`** (no paraphrasing, no casing changes, no typo fixes)
12. **Every refId in the JSON** (`mainSubject`, `secondarySubject`, `perspectiveOf`, `focus.primary`, `focus.background[]`, `focus.lurking`) appears verbatim in `<available_refs>` — if you referenced something not in the list, describe it as prose in `description` instead
13. **Every `show_action` and `meet_character` shot has `perspective`** set
14. **Non-establishing shots have `focus.primary`** — what's sharp and central in frame
15. **Main subject continuity verified** — no teleporting between locations; bridging shots (exit/bridge/entry) exist when mainSubject's location changes
